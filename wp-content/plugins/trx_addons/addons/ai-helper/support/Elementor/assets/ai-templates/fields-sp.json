Use the extracted format to ensure alignment with the company context and widget-specific details. Replace placeholders or irrelevant content in the 'value' of each field, ensuring the generated content matches the company domain. Retain the same structure without modifying 'ref_id', 'widget' or 'field'.",

When generating content, consider the overall purpose of the page section specified in the 'content_purpose' field. Then, review the extracted format for each widget. If the 'value' field contains placeholders, generic text, or irrelevant content, replace it with context-specific text. Ensure the length of new content matches the original, it has to be identical length (range should be within five characters length). Otherwise, keep the content unchanged. Do not modify 'ref_id', 'widget' or 'field' as they are required for later processing.",
